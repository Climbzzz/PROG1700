1. The grocery order felt the most realistic. You dont often see how many hours you listen to a song on spotify, YT music, etc. While the grocery order has math and is seen more as an everyday occurance.

2. Loops make it easier to put inputs in faster, and easier to sort later on with simpler codes like lambda. Adding key values are crucial for sorting as well

3. Adding them all together was definitely a struggle. Sometimes the song name would duplicate, or loop or not add the values and just jamble things all over. I had to well think out all of the code and try my hardest to conigure and understand new commands like lambda, get, and zip.
 
4. Adding a recipt to the grocery list, in order of purchased items, or able to add coupouns for discounts on certain items like milk or eggs. There are so many options to explore and think about for all of these projects
