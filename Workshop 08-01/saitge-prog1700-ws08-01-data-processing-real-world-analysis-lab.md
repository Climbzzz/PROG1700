## **1. Activity Overview**

In this workshop, you‚Äôll work through four practical mini-projects that apply loops and collections to real-world data.
Each scenario uses lists, sets, or dictionaries to **store**, **analyze**, and **report** data ‚Äî just like beginner data automation tasks in workplaces.

All code will be written **procedurally** (no functions or methods) to strengthen logical thinking and flow control.

---

## **2. Learning Objectives**

By completing this workshop, you will be able to:

* Combine `for` and `while` loops with collection data types to manage and summarize data.
* Build simple data analysis scripts for real-world scenarios.
* Apply counting, filtering, and aggregation techniques using basic Python structures.
* Create readable, formatted console output.

---

## **3. Concept Review / Lesson Content**

Common patterns for analyzing data:

```python
# Loop through list
for item in my_list:
    ...

# Process dictionary
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    ...

# Validate input
while user_input != "done":
    ...
```

These patterns are the backbone of procedural programming ‚Äî every task today will apply one or more of them.

---

## **4. Integrated Tutorial / Guided Activities**

You will complete **four short data-driven scenarios**, each reinforcing loops + data processing.

---

### üå¶Ô∏è **A) Weather Reporter**

Analyze and summarize a week of temperature data.

```python
temperatures = [14, 16, 18, 17, 20, 19, 15]

total = 0
for temp in temperatures:
    total += temp

avg = total / len(temperatures)
print("Average temperature:", avg)
```

üí° **Try This:**

* Add a `while` loop to allow entering new temperatures.
* Find and print the **highest** and **lowest** temperatures.
* Count how many days were above 18¬∞C.
* Use a set to remove duplicate temperature readings.

---

### üìö **B) Library Checkout Log**

Track books checked out using a dictionary.

```python
books = {
    "Python Basics": 3,
    "Web Design 101": 2,
    "Networking Made Easy": 1
}

for title, qty in books.items():
    print(f"{title:25} copies: {qty}")
```

üí° **Try This:**

* Use a `while` loop to check out or return books.
* Prevent negative quantities with a warning.
* Display the book with the fewest remaining copies.
* Print a summary showing total books in circulation.

---

### ‚òï **C) Campus Caf√© Sales**

Use lists to store sales and compute totals.

```python
items = ["Latte", "Espresso", "Tea", "Muffin"]
sales = [12, 8, 10, 6]
```

üí° **Try This:**

* Print a formatted sales report.
* Calculate total and average sales per item.
* Add new items interactively in a `while` loop.
* Create a set of all **unique** menu items sold.
* Identify the **best-selling** item.

---

### üêæ **D) Pet Adoption Tracker**

Keep a record of animal adoptions using dictionaries and sets.

```python
adoptions = {
    "Cats": 4,
    "Dogs": 6,
    "Rabbits": 2
}

for species, count in adoptions.items():
    print(f"{species:10} adopted: {count}")
```

üí° **Try This:**

* Allow users to log more adoptions until ‚Äúdone.‚Äù
* Prevent negative totals or invalid entries.
* Store all animal types seen in a **set** (unique species).
* Print a report: total adoptions and most popular pet.

---

## **5. Reflection**

Add the following to the bottom of your `.py` file:

```python
# Reflection:
# 1. Which dataset (weather, library, caf√©, or pets) was easiest to work with, and why?
# 2. How do loops make repetitive tasks faster in programming?
# 3. Which collection type (list, set, or dict) felt most useful today?
# 4. Describe one improvement you would make if this lab continued next week.
```

---

## **6. Deliverables**

Submit one `.py` file named:
`studentnumber_PROG1700_ws08-01.py`

Include:

* All four completed tasks (A‚ÄìD)
* Clear comments labeling each section
* Reflection answers as comments at the end

---

## **7. Submission**

* Submit through **Brightspace** (or GitHub if instructed).
* **Due:** End of class.
* Ensure your file runs correctly with no syntax errors.
* Include your name and student number in file header.
